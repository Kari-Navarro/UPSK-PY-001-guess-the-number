### Sprint learnings

This week (13 - 20 February), I've learned several fundamental concepts in Python programming. I learned how to utilize the **print function** to display information on the screen. Additionally, I look for the importation of modules, specifically the **random module**, which allows the generation of random numbers within a specified range.

Furthermore, I familiarized myself with implementing loops, particularly the **while loop**, and how to utilize the **append function** to add elements to an empty list dynamically. This understanding opens up possibilities for efficient data handling and manipulation.

In terms of decision-making, I was implementing conditionals such as 'if', 'elif', and 'else'. 

Moreover, I encountered and learned to handle exceptions, specifically the Value Error, which occurs when an operation receives an argument of the correct type but with an inappropriate value. 

Overall, the new concepts and practices I learned this week will significantly improve my technical skills in Python.


### Added

* Now, there are two players, the PC and the human player.
* The numbers range from 1 to 100.
* The PC and the human player take turns in rounds.
* With print() function, the player can see the number that PC obtained
* There are some clues, if the number is too low or too high
* The program displays the numbers suggested by both the player and the PC to guess the random number.
* The program also shows the number of attempts taken by the PC or human player to guess the random number.
